/**
 * Stream.....
 * 1. Element sequence: Streams represent a sequence of elements.
 * 2. Functional Operations: Operations like map, filter, and reduce.
 * 3. No storage: Streams don't store data, they process it on-the-fly from sources like collections or arrays.
 * 4. Efficiency: Stream operations can be lazy, processing elements only as needed, which is efficient for large data.
 * 5. One-Time use: Streams are consumable; once processed they can't be processed again.
 * 6. Parallel capable: They support parallel processing, making operations faster by utilizing multiple threads.
